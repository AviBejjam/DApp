# Decentralized Supply Chain Management

## Overview
This project is a blockchain-based supply chain management system designed to enhance transparency and traceability of goods. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures product authenticity, automates operations, and streamlines supply chain processes. The front end is built with React, enabling seamless interaction with smart contracts, secure user authentication via MetaMask, and peer-to-peer transactions. Real-time tracking features provide users with end-to-end visibility of the supply chain.

## Features
- **Transparency and Traceability**: Track the history and origin of products.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate operations and enforce data integrity.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Secure user authentication and peer-to-peer transactions.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor goods in real-time throughout the supply chain.
- **React Frontend**: User-friendly interface for interacting with blockchain smart contracts.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) (for local blockchain development)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (browser extension for Ethereum wallet)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AB/DApp.git
   cd DApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for the React app:**
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Ganache:**
   - Open Ganache and create a new workspace.
   - Deploy your smart contracts using Ganache's local blockchain.

4. **Configure environment:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `app` directory.
   - Add your smart contract addresses and MetaMask configuration

5. **Run the React application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Connect to MetaMask:**
   - Install the MetaMask browser extension and connect to the Ganache network.

2. **Interact with Smart Contracts:**
   - Use the React front end to perform actions like validating product history, initiating peer-to-peer transactions, and tracking goods in real-time.

3. **Track Products:**
   - View real-time updates of product location and status.

## Smart Contracts
The smart contracts automate operations like:
- Validating product authenticity.
- Recording transactions.
- Updating the status and location of goods.

Deployed using Ganache for local development.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Frontend**: React
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Local Blockchain**: Ganache
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask

## Future Improvements
- Implement a decentralized file storage system (e.g., IPFS) for storing product certificates.
- Expand support for multiple blockchain networks.
